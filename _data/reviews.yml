    title: "Fantastic!"
    content: "As a former teacher and now homeschooling mom, I’m always on the lookout for quality children’s and Young Adult books. My kids have loved the Prince Martin series for years. They’re well written, entertaining, and teach great lessons. I’m absolutely delighted that there’s now a Prince Martin option for younger kids! First, it’s just a good story. My 5 year old has asked me to read it several times already. It’s engaging, as expected, and the additional illustrations helped keep his attention. There are a few less-common words, which I consider a positive. Use a good vocabulary, and your kids will develop a good vocabulary! My son was able to figure out the meanings of the unfamiliar words using context clues when I read it to him, but an early reader trying to read the story independently might need a little help with them. I’m always in favor of kids’ books with a good moral, and the author’s note at the end explains it’s a retelling of a personal experience, which is even better. It’s a great story and an excellent book! I hope this is the beginning of a long series of Little Prince Martin books! We will be buying them all."

Our family has long been a fan of Prince Martin, but this Little Prince Martin book is something special! We’ve enjoyed the chapter books as read-a-louds for the whole family ages 4–10, boys and girls. My younger ones love the books, but can’t enjoy them on their own. But this sweet little book is a perfect bedtime book to be read aloud. It can be read in one sitting, and the illustrations keep the attention of the little ones bringing keeping them engaged through the whole story!

The rhyming verse is fun to read for parents and children alike. My 6 yo was so excited that he could finally read a Prince Martin book for himself with “Honesty Pays”. No doubt, he’ll be devouring the rest of the series on his own very soon!

The author does a beautiful job showing how temptation feels and how it’s like a weed that can spring up and grow. I love how doing the right thing allowed a special ending to this sweet story. The coloring pages that are included are wonderful and made the story come alive for my kids. I’m thankful for good-quality books for my boys! The knight theme to this one was a favorite!"

My kids have really enjoyed the Prince Martin series, and the first Little Prince Martin is one of my 5 yr old’s favorite books. He was very excited about reading this new one! As always, there are positive themes about accountability, doing what’s right, etc. Also as usual, there were just a few advanced words that I had to explain. I like that these books encourage a good vocabulary, so that’s not a criticism in my opinion. I bought the kindle version of the book right away, and I will be getting the hard copy soon as well."

However, like all good picture books, the treasures inside are not limited to just the young. The value of virtues and the wealth of vocabulary make it a worthy story for all ages. It inspires one to grow in virtue, to look at how to lend a hand, and to grow toward the person you are meant to be. We’re happy to add this new title to our collection!"

The Prince Martin series is a great ongoing novel that also includes virtuous lessons, while also being extremely catchy and appealing to younger readers! The ultimate flow of all the chapters leading to the other, and the illustrations which show what exactly the text is referring to, really draws you in. Even for children with five-second attention spans, I think this book will be able to entertain and teach them about good morals! His poetry is never redundant, and it never gets old or boring! I recommend the Prince Martin books to any reader who appreciates poetry or even younger kids who enjoy bedtime stories! Phenomenal work! Thank you again for such an inspiring and thoughtful book, Brandon! As you say, remain loyal, brave, and true!"

Through accomplishing the birthday tasks his father gives him to do, the young prince earns many of the “rewards” the readers of the book series are familiar with including his boots, slingshot, and satchel. He also comes to recognize the merits of hard work (mucking out the stables…) learning lessons of accomplishment and charity. We highly recommend this read (and it’s best read aloud). Our grandsons gave it a 10 out of 10."

A shorter picture book style, Little Prince Martin is written in the same engaging rhyming text as the chapter books. In this brightly illustrated children’s book, Martin finds joy in helping others while spending the day with the Marshall, Steward, Blacksmith, Knight, Huntsman, and Armorer. Written in a way to hold the attention of our grandkids 6, 6, 7 and 8 (boys and girls) with its sense of adventure inspired by an Ancient Herculean epic, it also held rapt the attention of our two 4 year old grandkids - a testament to Brandon Hale’s storytelling gift and Jason Zimdar’s radiant illustrations.

Prince Martin has a valuable lesson to learn about serving others before himself in this story, and Mr. Hale executes that lesson with examples and language that is easy for young children to understand. Our kids were also able and excited to see the ties between this story and the Prince Martin novels.

    content: "This book is the PERFECT addition to the already excellent Prince Martin Series which has been as staple for my 4 boys as they have learned to read and grown into the epic adventures. I love that the Seven Labors story is bite sized for bed time, it brings in some grown up vocabulary that encourages parent involvement but still maintains the rhyming and cadence that has been demonstrably helpful for young readers. The theme of all the Prince Martin books is exactly what we need in our house (in our world) and we can not get enough of the adventures that are presented through a wholesome lens that speaks Virtue without being cheesy or preachy. It’s hard to choose, but this one might be my favorite of all because birthdays are a big important part of large families with lots of kids so it is right on point!!"

    content: "The Prince Martin series is our family’s absolute favorite! We can’t get enough of the engaging rhymes, character values, and Christian perspective. In the beautifully written story “Little Prince Martin and the Seven Labors,” Prince Martin celebrates his birthday. While one might expect it to revolve around him, the narrative takes a positive turn as he focuses on helping his neighbors instead. This book ignites imagination and even encourages adults to enhance their character. It has sparked meaningful conversations and questions, such as, “What can we do for our neighbors like Prince Martin did?” It’s been delightful to watch my children enjoy Prince Martin’s adventures and make connections on how they can be brave, strong, and supportive of those around them by looking beyond themselves."

    title: "Short but Satisfying - Great Book for Boys"
    content: "I have read with enjoyment every book in the world of Prince Martin, and this short storybook does not disappoint. The seven books in the Epic gradually grow in length and depth. This is a prequel, a good introduction to our young hero, and a stand alone story book that both pleases and teaches. I was surprised by the meatiness of the vocabulary. The five to eight year old target audience will need their parents’ help with “denote”, “facile” and “auspicious”. I had to look up “shoat” myself. But the story is very understandable, and relatable to the lads it’s aimed at. On his birthday, the Prince is sent out to perform seven useful tasks - and he gets rewarded with a practical gift each time. More importantly, he is given instruction on how to use his rewards, and he learns that work can be fun, that he should do things without being told - and that charity to the disadvantaged is blessed. The plot is clear and resolves itself by the end. I highly recommend this book about a princeling’s birthday. It would make a good gift for any lad; even better, make it a birthday adventure by tasking your little squire with missions that earn the same or similar rewards. Buy this book for your laddie. When he likes it, give him the seven books in the epic, which will grow with him. (There is a coloring book too.) Full disclosure - as a Prince Martin aficionado, the author advanced me the Kindle edition for review. But I have already ordered the paperback. Old fashioned adventurers prefer libraries to ephemeral phantom formats. And, btw, a “shoat” is a piglet just weaned. If I ever knew that, I had forgotten it."

The prose is easy enough for a 3rd grader to read on his own, but challenges them so they won’t feel like this is a baby story. My 7th and 8th grade children, who have read the Prince Martin chapter books, enjoyed this one just as much as their younger siblings. I love the character lesson in every Prince Martin story. Dealing with fear is such a difficult thing. Mr. Hale did an excellent job. I am going to share this as a read aloud with my 3rd grade class. Finally, the illustrations. The illustrations are so crisp and add to the story instead of detracting. These are my favorite books to give as birthday and shower gifts."

This book taught about overcoming fear, helping others in need, don’t judge anyone, and disabilities are not disabilities at all! My kids (ages 5,7, and 9) loved this book, and I personally cried at the end of the story! It tied in the values and lessons Prince Martin learned along the way and how just because Torbin was blind, he was capable of so much more than the Prince thought. It was beautiful!"

    content: "For the life of me, I cannot remember where I received the recommendation for the first Prince Martin book. I recall being impressed by the origins of the story, which began as a means to excite Hale’s children on phone conversations while he was deployed. As a military wife and mom, I appreciate that immensely, because we had to creatively inspire our kids in the same situation. I digress. My children received the first book for Christmas. They loved it. I loved it. All the books since have been a hit, but I will admit a special fondness for the latest, “Prince Martin and the Cave Bear,” primarily because it illustrates beautifully that we *all* have worth regardless of what initial impressions and assumptions are made. We all have worth despite what society says of our imperfections. We all matter. We all contribute. Brilliantly, the blind can enable the sighted to see clearly. My youngest child grapples with this idea, and Prince Martin answers the call. Additionally, facing fears is a constant subject in our home, and Prince Martin deftly dispenses with his own. Bravo, Mr. Hale."

I really liked how this book foreshadowed details and tied it together with colorful descriptions and a fabulous cadance. In fact, my teens eagerly took turns reading it out loud with their younger brother! With a variety of main characters my kids all found someone with whom to identify! As a homeschool mom who also has a masters in education, this is exactly the kind of book I like to find for both my own children and also my classroom students. The end of the book has a vocabulary section, which is inviting and not intimidating for students. Highly recommended!"

We read each of the previous books in one sitting and have come back to re-read them multiple times since first discovering them. For months and months they asked me almost every week when the newest entry in the series was due out. This has been an act of learning patience for them but finally Prince Martin and the Cave Bear was released... and they were not disappointed. This latest entry is approachable if this is your first Prince Martin adventure but even more enjoyable if you have grown to love some of the repeat characters. Each book teaches solid lessons that every parent should want their kid to learn. And, the cadence of the rhyming makes the books enjoyable and easy to read. Check this one out and enjoy!"

With enthusiasm, he would share with me what was happening in the book and his excitement couldn’t be contained. Over the past year, he has started reading chapter books on his own, and to have a book that pulls him in like this is an absolute treasure. As a parent, I love the writing style and the rich illustrations - it makes for a fun and enjoyable read together.

My 8 year old can read them on his own, or I’ll read them to them both. Takes a few days for us to work through them, but the 8 year old has read one or two of them in a couple sittings. Without all the terrible stuff out there targeting kids, this is a great series to reinforce key virtues every kid needs to learn and have fun doing it."

    title: "Best Book Ever"
    content: "My seven-year-old daughter gives this book five stars! We kept hearing about Prince Martin, but we hadn’t been able to get our hands on Prince Martin books at the library yet, so we were psyched when we were given an advance copy in exchange for an honest review. NOTE: Even though we started at book four in the series, we didn’t feel totally confused. The morals are refreshing. Modern books seem to have so many disrespectful characters for young readers. This story focuses on characters with true grit, and it shows children how not to judge others so quickly. Princess Meg may be a small girl, but she can take care of herself! Characters with physical disabilities are shown as helpful and tough. The main crew of characters even shows mercy to villains. The words have a definite rhythm that makes this great as a read-aloud. Even though my child is at a fourth or fifth grade reading level, there is a lot of rich vocabulary since she’s only seven. Fortunately, there is a glossary of “power words” at the book’s end, and most words are used multiple times throughout the story to enforce their value and increase your child’s exposure to them. So, this is a fine book for many ages, just be aware you may need to explain some of the vocabulary to your child as you go. Our only complaint is that we wish there were more illustrations. They go along perfectly with the text, and they are sharp, bold — absolutely attention-getting! They are a bit cartoonish and a bit sophisticated all at once, making them enjoyable for all ages."

    title: "My Grandson Will Be Thrilled"
    content: "I just read the latest installment in the adventures of Prince Martin, and I’m sure that my grandson is going to love this one as well. The previous books are beginning to get dogeared from his re-reading and carrying them from home to Grandma’s so he’ll be sure to have something fun to read here. This episode includes characters from previous books, so reading the earlier books first probably helps, but it serves as a stand-alone book as well. In this episode Prince Martin and his younger cousin Prince Meg embark on a mission to help a cave bear who has been sold to a circus. The book has twists, turns, near misses, and heartwarming interactions. The author has made his job more difficult in this series by writing the stories in rhyme, but his makes it more enjoyable as a read aloud book. Grown-ups may well catch some Tolkien allusions in this book. The author is trying to encourage virtuous traits in boys with his stories. In this one, Prince Martin has to overcome fear and an outright panic attack in order to save one of his friends, and an unexpected individual says the day at an important moment demonstrating that even people whom you think can’t contribute much sometimes have unique abilities. I can’t wait to get this one in hard copy because there is a six year old who was hoping to find it in his Easter basket. I should note that he is a really precocious reader, and this book is totally appropriate for boys older than him as well, they may even appreciate the glossary at the end of the book more than he will just yet."

This book begs to be read aloud, with its rhythm and canter, and my 4 children, ages 2 to 8, love the illustrations. This particular book is very intense at times because it deals with the reality of standing up for what is right, at all cost, facing the things one is most afraid of, and of confronting our own preconceived ideas about others. But, I can think of no better book, or book series to recommend than Prince Martin to address those topics with my children."

Each book in the series seems to get better, and they’re such a joy to read as a family. If you read the Kindle version, I recommend turning on the word-wise function. My son is constantly asking what a word means, and this is a handy tool. As is the glossary at the back. Don’t miss that. The author has done a great job providing personal context for the use of different words. The words come to life more and are easier for my kids to remember. The stories are always gripping, especially for my son, and as parents, we really appreciate the consistent themes of loyalty, bravery, courage, and caring for others. But the educational and literary aspects of this book, like all the others, are just so valuable. Time is well spent with Prince Martin!"

We have read every one in the series, & after the prince & his friends’ fight with the dragons (book 3), I thought that was as good as it could get. But I was surprised by Prince Martin & the Cave Bear. The heroes: a boy, an elf, a wolf and a dog are joined by a pint-sized heroine. They rescue a blind bear cub and risk their lives to return him to his family & home in the dangerous north, which is inhabited by fantastic beasts and fierce hunters. Prince Martin & his friends learn the value of compassion and doing right for right’s sake. They learn that a handicap doesn’t necessarily handicap someone. They learn that perseverance & hope are valuable virtues. My grandkids listened intently from the first page until the end. The glossary at the end was a fun addition as it explained words we hadn’t heard before (what it means to “count coup” & what a clowder of cats is - lol), which are now part of their vocabulary, just for the fun of it! These books are clean, very interesting, teach good principles (the Prince & Princess had to do a chore to earn the money to go to the circus, they are respectful to their parents, the friends are loyal to one another, they give their time to help others in need, etc.) Looking forward to this author’s next book.

The illustrations are deepening as well, showing more subtlety, as the themes of the story deepen book-by-book. Hats off to Messrs. Hale and Zimdars. The moral and life lessons are where I’m particularly impressed - from the simple story in the first book where there are a few clear-cut choices and the need to be brave and persevere, we have continued developments of that same theme, but coming closer to the sort of situations a child today may face - being laughed at, bullied, harrassed - but never compromising the moral. Building on the foundation of the previous, and bringing it closer to practical application. Deeper, step by step; or, further in and further up, as the Lion Himself would have it."

    title: "My Girls’ Favorite Chapter Book Series on Amazon"
    content: "I just absolutely love this series! The virtues that all the book hold are phenomenal. The books are adventurous and exciting, yet not overwhelming for young readers. I homeschool two girls, ages 5 and 7. I have read all the book out loud to them because we have so enjoyed them together. This book would probably be their very favorite because of Princess Meg and the flying contractions are so wonderful to picture. When I pause at the end of the chapter to pick it up later in the day, my seven-year-old groans because she wants to continue! This is exactly the type of literature we need more of right now."

    content: "Two dragons have come to terrorize the shepherds and their sheep. In the meantime the king has been hearing rumors regarding these dastardly dragons. Their names are Mortis and Ardoris. They only awaken every 2,000 years and this is the year! The wizard tells the people gathered about some special weapons. The king orders Prince Martin, Sir Ray and friends to go find the shield and silvery spear. Who else do the two enlist? BTW Sir Ray is not who you might imagine. He is a dog! The two dragons are filled with evil intent with never any remorse. It is time to end their rampaging but will Prince Martin and his crew succeed? Will Sir Ray survive his encounter with one of the dragons? This, the third book in the series, is a stand alone story but you’ll really want to start at the beginning if you have not already done so. FANTASTIC series! Written in rhyme but not set out like poetry. GREAT ending. I, as an adult, have read this entire fantasy series and you can pass them onto your kids with no fear of them reading something they shouldn’t. Chivalry is not dead. Thanks, Liz"

    content: "...courage and adventure, this is a series you can’t miss out on! I’m a firm believer in quality books, not just for toddlers, but also for budding readers. This is the perfect series to instill good qualities in your elementary age children while inspiring them to read! Mystery, danger, companionship and talking animals are all brought to life once again in Prince Martin and the Dragons, not to mention brightly colored illustrations that are surprisingly modern. Combined with the familiar bravery of Martin and his pals, their respectful mannerisms and courage to help those in need, and the lyrical flow of this adventure, these are sure to win over a reluctant reader (or a tired parent who has to read one more book)! We’ve read the first 2 books in the series multiple times and now the addition of dragons in this 3rd book only further solidifies my 5-year-old’s obsession with everything Prince Martin. We also have a 4 and 2 year old that love to listen in when I read these aloud as well as 2 nephews (ages 7 & 9) so it’s practically a guarantee that these will entertain for many years! We’ve only bought the Kindle versions of this series and there have been no errors in the publications. Great quality and we look forward to investing in the real books soon."

    title: "If you have a young boy in your life, make sure he has this series!"
    content: "The Prince Martin books are a rarity in our time - they unabashedly teach young boys that it is a GOOD thing to grow up to be brave, decisive, honorable men - yes, that boys can even aspire to become noble warriors! Yet, these important lessons are couched in rollicking verse that effortlessly entertains the young listeners (and introduces them to an astonishly advanced vocabulary, too). Prince Martin and the Dragon is considerably longer than the first two books, but is so compelling that it is easily read. Not to give anything away, but look for a passage that evokes Gandalf and the Balrog and is nearly as touching. And though this tale ends happily, be prepared to shed a tear or two at the final paragraph. In short, if you have a young boy in your life, make sure he has this series!"

    content: "Every book in the Prince Martin series has been such a joy to read — for both my son and me. My four-year old son and I often will read the entire book in a single sitting, which speaks to how well the Prince Martin stories keep your attention. Prince Martin and the Dragons is packed with action and adventure and the themes of bravery, courage, and self sacrifice are easy to pick up on for kids. I considered it the most exciting of the first three books. It also reads a bit differently thay the previous books. It’s especially fluid, and there are more and shorter chapters, which I think made it a bit easier for my son to digest each scene. Also, it seemed to contain a few more pictures than the prior books, which my son especially appreciated. I can tell he’s always eagerly waiting for that next picture! It’s a great read, and like the others I highly recommend it."

But as my son has grown up reading these over the past few years, it was perfect and had him captivated. It’s longer than others in the PM series but still packed with great illustrations throughout. While we’ve been able to read a few in a single sitting, this one definitely required a few evenings. Every night my son was begging me to read “just one more” chapter. I love that my son finds these books so thrilling, and that at the same time I know he’s getting exposed to some great messages ... character formation, the battle between good and evil, and the virtues. As with all in the PM series, it’s such an educational read. There isn’t a better series of books out there if you want to build your kid’s vocabulary. Lots of conversations as we read about what a word means. Would really love to see this turned into a mini series some day!"

I am so happy to have found books that hold my children’s attention and capture their imagination, while also giving them heroes of character and virtue.

We love the series so much I gave it to my friend’s son of the same age and we even got him hooked! And a bonus at the end of the book the author will e-mail your child a map to color after reading the book! So, so great! Don’t hesitate order the entire series! :)"

    title: "Another epic adventure!"
    content: "First, I am so glad the pirates are the bad guys! I am tired of media portraying thieves as noble or fun-loving freedom fighters! They are thieves and they should not be people we teach our children to admire or imitate. Second, I love the lesson on speaking out of turn. Maybe because it is something that my oldest and myself are currently working on, but it is a great lesson for all children. I think too often our society portrays adults as idiots and children need to save the day, but this is a far cry from reality. Children should be taught to respect their elders, especially their parents, and know their places among adults. This is not to disrespect the children, but they need to learn manners because as in the case of Prince Martin, the consequences can be dire! Third, my son loved this epic and briny adventure with the brotherly band and I did too! We can’t wait for the next story!"

    title: "Virtuous!"
    content: "Prince Martin and The Pirates is the 6th book that my (now 8yrs. old) grandson and I read together. There are many lessons that are learned while reading this book that we discuss with each other. An example is one of good fathering. It entails Prince Martin’s questioning of his father’s decision to not allow him to go along on a rescue mission in front of others at a meeting. His father explains later in private why he should never do this ( question his father) in front of others. In the events that follow, Prince Martin sees this lesson played out and he learns the wisdom in his father’s words. My grandson and I talked about this and we were able to talk about trust and the importance of trusting God The Father. So many lessons in this book ( and all in the group) are about building character in boys….. so much needed in today’s world in which some boys are growing up in homes in which there are fathers who are either absent or have not been taught good fathering. The illustrations are excellent and rightly complement the story. For example, the pirates are drawn to be scary bad guys who do evil. They are not shown to be silly dilly non- scary men to downplay evildoers. We SHOULD be afraid of doing evil and offending our Heavenly Father! But also, the tale has a pirate who changed from doing evil to doing good ( repentance )."

    content: "A merchant ship is boarded by a black galleon full of pirates in the Tropical Main. But this was no ordinary assault, the Pirate Captain had a bird on his shoulder with a metal beak, and this vulture spoke instead of the captain and threatened the ships crew with death if they tried to escape, and the pirate captain looked like a ghost with greasy black hair, coal black eyes and he was 7 feet tall! The King, Queen, Prince Martin and his advisors held a meeting to discuss what had happened to one of the Kings ships out on the Coconut Sea. Ned, a sailor, told them about a wreck he had seen that had the Kings crest but she was full of holes, her mast was destroyed, and she was battered and burning and empty of cargo. A black pirate flag flew from her hull, this signified that pirates had destroyed one of the Kings’ ships, the white skull of a bird was on it signifying that Caddaric Kane destroyed her. Then Ned told an awful tale of joining these pirates as a young teenager, he told how the Pirate Captain had venomous hissing jailers that kept the prisoners working for them and even using them as food! Then Ned repented of his life at 16 and became a fisherman. The King forgave Ned and told him his new life absolved him Ned offered his assistance apprehending Captain Kane."

I love that she gets to experience a fun story, great writing (in rhyme!), and characters worthy of our respect. This particular book was more intense than some of the others. She found Captain Kaine frightening. On the other hand, bad guys are supposed to be frightening! The plot twists were less expected this time, too, which made the story even more fun for me to read with her. I hope you enjoy this swashbuckling adventure as much as we did!"

    title: "The Prince Martin epic continues to please!"
    content: "The sixth book in the Prince Martin epic holds true to the lovable characters and inspiring virtues we’ve come to associate with the series. Author Brandon Hale introduces the story with background information about real pirates, their unmistakable role in the world as villains, and a recommendation for a rendition of a battle hymn that comes up in the book. This information, along with all of nautical terms, gave us a chance to spin off from the story and delve into the seafaring culture Mr. Hale had presented. The Prince Martin series is enjoyed by my children from ages 5–12. They look forward to each new book and appreciate the rhyming writing style and the captivating story lines. Prince Martin and the Pirates is no exception. I appreciate that Mr. Hale assumes the intelligence of his reader and does not water down the vocabulary of his series but raises the bar for children while still making the story accessible. The illustrations are endearing and help insert the reader into the kingdom of The West and the pirate domain of the Tropical Main where readers’ imaginations can flourish, fueled by the daring deeds of Prince Martin and the Brotherly Band. This story, as well as the preceding five, make great family reading for young boys and girls looking for adventure and growing in virtue. Our family highly recommends you hit the high seas with Martin and his crew!"

As Prince Martin grows up in the series, the stakes grow higher and the battles against evil intensify. Hale’s engaging plots, epic rhyming and enriching vocabulary make his books our favorite read aloud—and this book is the best one yet! My son particularly enjoyed absorbing all the plot details to predict how the Brotherly Band would prevail. The tempting offer to sell out the Kingdom to save their lives was just one of the many conversation starters about making good choices in complex situations."

I asked him, “Are you going to read until you have finished the book?!” He looked at me with a coy smile and replied, “How can I not!” I enjoyed hearing his vocal comments when he got to the most interesting parts.

Of interest are... seeds for the future, when your boy reads important works and thinks of important ideas.

Our 18 year old referred to the author as “A Dr Seuss of the Modern Age” *Amazing recap by the peregrine falcon (you don’t have to have read the prior books, although we highly recommend them all!) *The book encourages kids to obey parents & authority *Our 16 year old says, “I love these books! My only issue are the ships. Pirates used sloops & merchants used galleons. Usually sloops are much faster than galleons, so the Pirates shouldn’t have been able to catch up.” *Our 10 year old says, “I like them a lot! They are fun & easy to read.” (They were the first books he read by himself). *Our 14 year old says, “I liked how he talked about the sea monsters & snails (& the pictures!” Each of the books have grand adventures you won’t want to miss.

    title: "An action-packed tale of betrayal, forgiveness, and redemption"
    content: "Perhaps the most morally complex of the Prince Martin sagas so far, this novel explores some of the sinister attacks on masculinity, from over-competitiveness on the one hand to mindless screen-time addiction and total dissipation on the other. It also tackles issues of the female heart including the quest for beauty above all else, contrasted with a gentle, quiet, steadfastly heroinic spirit. And the story shows the importance of comradery above individual glory, while also demonstrating the path of redemption (and forgiveness) from a fatal mistake. With perhaps the most hideous enemy we have seen so far, this Prince Martin novel is a must-have in your collection. Don’t miss the other six if you haven’t read them already! There will be plenty to talk about with your sons (and daughters)!"

    content: "At first, I had some trouble following the story - as one reviewer wrote, it jumps between characters and time lines. But as I read on, it became like an exciting movie and it all came together. Hale has obviously chosen to make each Prince Martin book longer than the last, with more difficult vocabulary and more intricate plots. Bloodstone may improve on a second reading. I’d give it 5 stars except I want to warn parents that it may be a stretch for younger readers/listeners. Like the six books that came before, Bloodstone balances pathos and logos, and leaves the reader improved by the experience. And it would, actually, make a good motion picture."

    title: "Prince Martin continues to grow"
    content: "It’s been almost 6 years of our time since Prince Martin first won his sword, and while he may only have aged about a year in the books, the themes, stakes, and world have grown immensely. The first hints of expansive worldbuilding came in Prince Martin and the Cave Bear, but it really kicked into high gear with the Last Centaur with the introduction of the Sower and Child tale that underpins the saga. It was great to see that story line expanded in this volume. The themes of this book are likewise expanded. In a bold move for a children’s story, Mr. Hale gives a glimpse of a mentor figure’s struggles and shortcomings. Yet he presents it in a way that teaches that struggles are a continuous part of life, rather than a nihilistic no-heroes view. This entry also sees the stakes increased. While one of the best parts of previous books has always been the very real life-or-death stakes, the results of failure have always been relatively limited in scope. Bandits and pirates might win for a time, but their victory will always be limited by the natural passing of time. The ancient evil and corruption in this story carries much more far-reaching potential, and the tension is noticeably higher. This book was also unique in that not all the lessons were for children. There is a subplot that is challenging to parents, as well. He grapples with the understandable desire of parents to keep children safe, and the unintended consequences of taking that desire too far."

    title: "Ever Faithful"
    content: "This is the seventh book in the Prince Martin series that I’ve read to my son. We started with Prince Martin Wins His Sword before he could even read. And now that he is older, he still insists that I continue to read Prince Martin stories to him when they come out. He is an accomplished reader at 10 and perfectly capable of reading the book himself, but I never hesitate to spend time reading Mr. Hale’s books to him when asked. Our time with Prince Martin and his friends has become a tradition, and one that I’m only too happy to continue. Why? Because the books are full of adventure and exploration, but also heroism, sacrifice, friendship, loyalty, justice, generosity, and hope; traits and virtues that seemed to have fallen out of favor in today’s society in general and children’s books specifically. Prince Martin and the Quest for the Bloodstone is our favorite in the series thus far. The story is exciting as always, with plenty of twists and turns to keep young readers guessing. There is also a BBEG monster which the companions get to face. And of course all of the usual elements are present but in novel ways. But what made this tale stand out to me was the extensive backstory to set up an epic redemption arc. As I continued to read to my son nightly, we could sense the arc coming to fruition and when it finally happened, we were not disappointed. It was just as satisfying as the end battle. Well done Mr. Hale!"

We have been reading Prince Martin since my son was 8. Each new book seems to address a season of life he is going through. The Quest for the Bloodstone is no different. The themes of perseverance, faithfulness, and diligence abound in this book. The author does an excellent job developing the female characters to make this great choice as a family read aloud. This book does take a different approach however. Prince Martin takes a secondary role, as Ted the Treetender is in the front. There are several new supporting characters whose stories add a depth to the tale as well. Definitely one of my favorites!"

It’s also a great addition to the Prince Martin series giving the back story on Ted the Treetender. Each subsequent book in the series provides additional characters and storyline while incorporating each of the characters from the previous books. This is a unique, entertaining story with a captivating plot and relatable, virtuous, heroic characters told in a fun rhyming text. It has a heavily detailed, well thought out storyline.

In a faraway forest many years ago the Sower and the Child were planting seeds, an evil creature bit the Child and was banished underground and named the Mullock. The rock the Child’s blood fell on was called the Bloodstone and the seed the creature Mullock spit out caused a moss to spread. Many years afterwards the Bloodstone gave life to the forest and its people, but the moss spread sickness and decay. The Treetender elf, Tadaaki, who tended the Bloodstone forest had disappeared, and Prince Martin and his friends were sent to find him and save the forest from the deadly moss.

    content: "This series is a fun, exciting read for all ages. What a good book to read to little pre-readers, and perfect for older children who have a hard time getting excited about books. The vocabulary is accessible, yet challenging enough to retain interest. But the storylines are compelling, and rhyme is universally beloved by the young and old - and it sure makes the reading fun! I plan to use this series as the first book(s) as the opening of a book club for children/youths. Besides, it’s good for the soul to see good win for a change."

    title: "For lovers of Heros and other Epic Reads"
    content: "Prince Martin and The Thieves is a fast paced swash- buckling read but suited for the child who can handle Tom Sawyer -perhaps 5th grade reader for content and style. As the story opens Prince Martin and his dog-friend Ray are hanging by 2 snares of the peg- trigger kind suspended from trees, but event is really NOT the beginning of the story! Their adventure begins, with a chore- or a quest and this task is from the King- so they must do their best! “To carry a gift to the north- an 80 mile journey on foot, back and forth.” The prose actually becomes surprisingly engaging ( if not always perfect), and the Tale of the quest -duty and honor bound - yields a series of acts & consequences for dog and Prince. ...(Ray defends the honor of a barmaid who was pinched!) The remainder of the story unfolds in delightful fashion and is not to be missed! 4 stars for me but maybe 5 for lovers of the bard . Me? I am waiting his falcon stories which are sure to come!"

We look forward to more Prince Martin Books."

    content: "Mr. Hale has once again brought us a tale of not only courage, but friendship and kindness from the knight-prince, Martin. My 5 year old boy adores these stories. They scarf up the illustrations and wish there were more! I love that it holds their attention until the next picture. One of my favorite parts is when the Prince invests his time into listening to a beggars story. It is a subtle nod to emotional help being as important as money for the homeless, as well as teaching children that finding out the back story is important in deciding whether to give money or not. We’re waiting for the next books to appear!"

    title: "Great way to inspire kids to be courageous and compassionate"
    content: "I really enjoyed this chapter book in verse. The story is the kind of story I loved as a kid, and I’m sure my own kids will love it also. I’ll wait a couple of years to read it to my youngest two (all my kids are under 6 years old right now) since I think some of the situations might be too scary for little ones. Having said that though, I think this is the kind of story kids need to hear (and enjoy hearing) because they see scary things around them in the world and know those things are real. This story shows a kid facing scary situations and doing the right thing even when it’s hard or frightening. The situations aren’t so scary that they’re inappropriate for school-age kids, and there is no graphic violence. I would encourage parents to read it by themselves first so they can decide whether their kids are at the right age to deal with the themes, and also so that they can be prepared to answer any questions the story may raise. The themes of courage, loyalty, kindness, generosity and compassion are relevant to every era and every kid. Our kids will face these things in real life. I want to give mine the chance to face them in story form first, so they know what to do when it’s their turn."
