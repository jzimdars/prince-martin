<p><b>A boy prince and his canine sidekick are caught and held for ransom by ruthless robbers! Do past good deeds pay dividends? Could help come from where it's least expected?</b></p>
<p>If your son is a reluctant reader, the Prince Martin Epic series is a perfect fit because each book features:</p>
<p>High-stakes action-adventure and danger</p>
<p>Brilliant color illustrations that burst off the page</p>
<p>Text that appears to be prose--but <i>subtly rhymes,</i> gently nudging the boy along as he is encouraged to find the next rhyme</p>
<p>This is the perfect formula for engaging <i>boy</i> readers.</p>
<p>Parents and grandparents will love this series because each tale contains a moral--without a lecture--that encourages the virtues of bravery, loyalty, grit, and compassion, which are character traits boys need to become good men. And each book in the series gets a bit longer and more epic, thus growing with the boy.</p>
<p>Ages 7 and up.<br><br></p>
<p>Read as a stand-alone or as Book 2 in the series.</p>
<p>Available in standard grayscale paperback, premium full-color paperback, and full-color hardcover. 9" x 6", 93 pages.</p>
