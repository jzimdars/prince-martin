The vocabulary is accessible, yet challenging enough to retain interest. But the storylines are compelling, and rhyme is universally beloved by the young and old - and it sure makes the reading fun! I plan to use this series as the first book(s) as the opening of a book club for children/youths. Besides, it’s good for the soul to see good win for a change.</blockquote>

        <blockquote class="txt-medium">Prince Martin and The Thieves is a fast paced swash- buckling read but suited for the child who can handle Tom Sawyer -perhaps 5th grade reader for content and style. As the story opens Prince Martin and his dog-friend Ray are hanging by 2 snares of the peg- trigger kind suspended from trees, but event is really NOT the beginning of the story! Their adventure begins, with a chore- or a quest and this task is from the King- so they must do their best! “To carry a gift to the north- an 80 mile journey on foot, back and forth.” The prose actually becomes surprisingly engaging ( if not always perfect), and the Tale of the quest -duty and honor bound - yields a series of acts & consequences for dog and Prince. ...(Ray defends the honor of a barmaid who was pinched!) The remainder of the story unfolds in delightful fashion and is not to be missed! 4 stars for me but maybe 5 for lovers of the bard . Me? I am waiting his falcon stories which are sure to come!</blockquote>

They love Prince Martin & his friends’ adventures and I love the good solid values conveyed in each story. This one focused on the virtue of helping others who are in need, and how that brings it’s own reward. The heroes are brave, the villians are fierce, and the ending is very satisfying. We look forward to more Prince Martin Books.</blockquote>

        <blockquote class="txt-medium">Mr. Hale has once again brought us a tale of not only courage, but friendship and kindness from the knight-prince, Martin. My 5 year old boy adores these stories. They scarf up the illustrations and wish there were more! I love that it holds their attention until the next picture. One of my favorite parts is when the Prince invests his time into listening to a beggars story. It is a subtle nod to emotional help being as important as money for the homeless, as well as teaching children that finding out the back story is important in deciding whether to give money or not. We’re waiting for the next books to appear!</blockquote>

        <h3 class="txt-medium">Great way to inspire kids to be courageous and compassionate</h3>
        <blockquote class="txt-medium">I really enjoyed this chapter book in verse. The story is the kind of story I loved as a kid, and I’m sure my own kids will love it also. I’ll wait a couple of years to read it to my youngest two (all my kids are under 6 years old right now) since I think some of the situations might be too scary for little ones. Having said that though, I think this is the kind of story kids need to hear (and enjoy hearing) because they see scary things around them in the world and know those things are real. This story shows a kid facing scary situations and doing the right thing even when it’s hard or frightening. The situations aren’t so scary that they’re inappropriate for school-age kids, and there is no graphic violence. I would encourage parents to read it by themselves first so they can decide whether their kids are at the right age to deal with the themes, and also so that they can be prepared to answer any questions the story may raise. The themes of courage, loyalty, kindness, generosity and compassion are relevant to every era and every kid. Our kids will face these things in real life. I want to give mine the chance to face them in story form first, so they know what to do when it’s their turn.</blockquote>
