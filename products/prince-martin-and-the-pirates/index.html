        <blockquote class="txt-medium">First, I am so glad the pirates are the bad guys! I am tired of media portraying thieves as noble or fun-loving freedom fighters! They are thieves and they should not be people we teach our children to admire or imitate. Second, I love the lesson on speaking out of turn. Maybe because it is something that my oldest and myself are currently working on, but it is a great lesson for all children. I think too often our society portrays adults as idiots and children need to save the day, but this is a far cry from reality. Children should be taught to respect their elders, especially their parents, and know their places among adults. This is not to disrespect the children, but they need to learn manners because as in the case of Prince Martin, the consequences can be dire! Third, my son loved this epic and briny adventure with the brotherly band and I did too! We can’t wait for the next story!</blockquote>

        <h3 class="txt-medium">Virtuous!</h3>
        <blockquote class="txt-medium">Prince Martin and The Pirates is the 6th book that my (now 8yrs. old) grandson and I read together. There are many lessons that are learned while reading this book that we discuss with each other. An example is one of good fathering. It entails Prince Martin’s questioning of his father’s decision to not allow him to go along on a rescue mission in front of others at a meeting. His father explains later in private why he should never do this ( question his father) in front of others. In the events that follow, Prince Martin sees this lesson played out and he learns the wisdom in his father’s words. My grandson and I talked about this and we were able to talk about trust and the importance of trusting God The Father. So many lessons in this book ( and all in the group) are about building character in boys….. so much needed in today’s world in which some boys are growing up in homes in which there are fathers who are either absent or have not been taught good fathering. The illustrations are excellent and rightly complement the story. For example, the pirates are drawn to be scary bad guys who do evil. They are not shown to be silly dilly non- scary men to downplay evildoers. We SHOULD be afraid of doing evil and offending our Heavenly Father! But also, the tale has a pirate who changed from doing evil to doing good ( repentance ).</blockquote>

        <blockquote class="txt-medium">A merchant ship is boarded by a black galleon full of pirates in the Tropical Main. But this was no ordinary assault, the Pirate Captain had a bird on his shoulder with a metal beak, and this vulture spoke instead of the captain and threatened the ships crew with death if they tried to escape, and the pirate captain looked like a ghost with greasy black hair, coal black eyes and he was 7 feet tall! The King, Queen, Prince Martin and his advisors held a meeting to discuss what had happened to one of the Kings ships out on the Coconut Sea. Ned, a sailor, told them about a wreck he had seen that had the Kings crest but she was full of holes, her mast was destroyed, and she was battered and burning and empty of cargo. A black pirate flag flew from her hull, this signified that pirates had destroyed one of the Kings’ ships, the white skull of a bird was on it signifying that Caddaric Kane destroyed her. Then Ned told an awful tale of joining these pirates as a young teenager, he told how the Pirate Captain had venomous hissing jailers that kept the prisoners working for them and even using them as food! Then Ned repented of his life at 16 and became a fisherman. The King forgave Ned and told him his new life absolved him Ned offered his assistance apprehending Captain Kane.</blockquote>

        <blockquote class="txt-medium">My daughter (7) and I have been reading the books in the Prince Martin series over the last 2 years. She loves hearing about all the daring adventures Martin, John, Ted, and Sir Ray embark on. I love that she gets to experience a fun story, great writing (in rhyme!), and characters worthy of our respect. This particular book was more intense than some of the others. She found Captain Kaine frightening. On the other hand, bad guys are supposed to be frightening! The plot twists were less expected this time, too, which made the story even more fun for me to read with her. I hope you enjoy this swashbuckling adventure as much as we did!</blockquote>

        <h3 class="txt-medium">The Prince Martin epic continues to please!</h3>
        <blockquote class="txt-medium">The sixth book in the Prince Martin epic holds true to the lovable characters and inspiring virtues we’ve come to associate with the series. Author Brandon Hale introduces the story with background information about real pirates, their unmistakable role in the world as villains, and a recommendation for a rendition of a battle hymn that comes up in the book. This information, along with all of nautical terms, gave us a chance to spin off from the story and delve into the seafaring culture Mr. Hale had presented. The Prince Martin series is enjoyed by my children from ages 5–12. They look forward to each new book and appreciate the rhyming writing style and the captivating story lines. Prince Martin and the Pirates is no exception. I appreciate that Mr. Hale assumes the intelligence of his reader and does not water down the vocabulary of his series but raises the bar for children while still making the story accessible. The illustrations are endearing and help insert the reader into the kingdom of The West and the pirate domain of the Tropical Main where readers’ imaginations can flourish, fueled by the daring deeds of Prince Martin and the Brotherly Band. This story, as well as the preceding five, make great family reading for young boys and girls looking for adventure and growing in virtue. Our family highly recommends you hit the high seas with Martin and his crew!</blockquote>

        <h3 class="txt-medium">The best book to teach boys about integrity and bravery</h3>
        <blockquote class="txt-medium">My son loves all the Prince Martin adventures! They are the few books that captivate him. I love that they always convey the virtues of integrity, friendship, honor, bravery, loyalty, and heroism. As Prince Martin grows up in the series, the stakes grow higher and the battles against evil intensify. Hale’s engaging plots, epic rhyming and enriching vocabulary make his books our favorite read aloud—and this book is the best one yet! My son particularly enjoyed absorbing all the plot details to predict how the Brotherly Band would prevail. The tempting offer to sell out the Kingdom to save their lives was just one of the many conversation starters about making good choices in complex situations.</blockquote>

        <blockquote class="txt-medium">Its been a long time since we have enjoyed a new Prince Martin book! I had forgotten how much I appreciated the sophistocated language. I read the first few chapters to my sons ages 9–5. When I stopped, my 9 year old grabbed my computer and spent the rest of the afternoon reading. I asked him, “Are you going to read until you have finished the book?!” He looked at me with a coy smile and replied, “How can I not!” I enjoyed hearing his vocal comments when he got to the most interesting parts. He said this is his favorite Prince Martin series yet! He especially enjoyed the underwater action.</blockquote>

        <h3 class="txt-medium">Grows year-by-year</h3>
        <blockquote class="txt-medium">Mr. Hale’s writing, and the tales he tells, grow year-by-year. They still rhyme (the more fun for reading aloud, of course, but maybe one day he will transition to Tolkienesque alliterative verse...) but have more mature material - the moral dilemmas and virtues required of the young prince are less straight-forward and simple, though still solid lessons for a growing lad. Of interest are... seeds for the future, when your boy reads important works and thinks of important ideas. Look for: Antediluvian, cyclopian monsters from the dawn of time Rose-fingered dawn A pearl of great price Men with chests “Let’s roll.” The return of the king</blockquote>

        <blockquote class="txt-medium">My 8 year old son and I have been anxiously awaiting for this newest Prince Martin book, a pirate adventure, and it hasn’t disappointed! The depictions of bravery against evil and danger, especially to protect and save others, is needed so much these days and definitely lacking. We haven’t completed the book yet, but so far it’s been what we’ve come to expect from this series, a great plot with a wonderful example for boys to follow. The artwork is absolutely stunning as well. We look forward to finishing it!</blockquote>

        <h3 class="txt-medium">Dr Seuss of the Modern Age</h3>
        <blockquote class="txt-medium">Our family LOVES the Prince Martin books & this one is no exception! I read them aloud to the kids, ages 18–3 & everyone listens in rapt attention & crowd around to see the pictures! Some of our favorite things: *Full color pictures - love that the author included a drawing he drew at age 6! *The book is rhyming & fun to read & listen to. Our 18 year old referred to the author as “A Dr Seuss of the Modern Age” *Amazing recap by the peregrine falcon (you don’t have to have read the prior books, although we highly recommend them all!) *The book encourages kids to obey parents & authority *Our 16 year old says, “I love these books! My only issue are the ships. Pirates used sloops & merchants used galleons. Usually sloops are much faster than galleons, so the Pirates shouldn’t have been able to catch up.” *Our 10 year old says, “I like them a lot! They are fun & easy to read.” (They were the first books he read by himself). *Our 14 year old says, “I liked how he talked about the sea monsters & snails (& the pictures!” Each of the books have grand adventures you won’t want to miss. Please keep writing! :)</blockquote>
