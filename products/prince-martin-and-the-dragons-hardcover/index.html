<h2>Can a boy prince and his pals rid the realm of devastating dragons?</h2>
<p>Prince Martin returns with his brotherly band to oppose ancient dragons that threaten the land!</p>
<p>The two dragons have slept for two thousand long years. They embody the worst of humanity’s fears. They have dreamt of destruction and fire and smoke. A new cycle begins—for the dragons just woke.</p>
<p>And these deadly old drakes are the nastiest sort: they incinerate cities and kill just for sport. Now they’re heading out west, these two blasts from the past. Their intentions are cruel. The die has been cast.</p>
<p>But a quest has begun for a shield and a spear—two long-missing marvels the two dragons fear. And the Prince and his friends join this perilous quest to discover those weapons and rescue The West. They have little idea, though, what lies in store...</p>
<p>When kids finish this book, they’ll come begging for more. Join the Prince, and the elf, and the wolf, and Sir Ray. There’s adventure aplenty—and dragons to slay!</p>
<p>Ages 8 and up. Read as a stand-alone or as Book 3 in the series. Available in: Paperback, Hardcover, Kindle, and Audiobook. 9″ x 6″, 98 pages.</p>
