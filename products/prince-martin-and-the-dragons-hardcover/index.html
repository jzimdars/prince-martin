      <div class="book__description">
        <h2>Can a boy prince and his pals rid the realm of devastating dragons?</h2>
<p>Prince Martin returns with his brotherly band to oppose ancient dragons that threaten the land!</p>
<p>The two dragons have slept for two thousand long years. They embody the worst of humanity’s fears. They have dreamt of destruction and fire and smoke. A new cycle begins—for the dragons just woke.</p>
<p>And these deadly old drakes are the nastiest sort: they incinerate cities and kill just for sport. Now they’re heading out west, these two blasts from the past. Their intentions are cruel. The die has been cast.</p>
<p>But a quest has begun for a shield and a spear—two long-missing marvels the two dragons fear. And the Prince and his friends join this perilous quest to discover those weapons and rescue The West. They have little idea, though, what lies in store...</p>
<p>When kids finish this book, they’ll come begging for more. Join the Prince, and the elf, and the wolf, and Sir Ray. There’s adventure aplenty—and dragons to slay!</p>
<p>Ages 8 and up. Read as a stand-alone or as Book 3 in the series. Available in: Paperback, Hardcover, Kindle, and Audiobook. 9″ x 6″, 98 pages.</p>

        <h3 class="txt-medium">~~ Is there any hope of defeating the dastardly dragons? ~~</h3>
        <blockquote class="txt-medium">Two dragons have come to terrorize the shepherds and their sheep. In the meantime the king has been hearing rumors regarding these dastardly dragons. Their names are Mortis and Ardoris. They only awaken every 2,000 years and this is the year! The wizard tells the people gathered about some special weapons. The king orders Prince Martin, Sir Ray and friends to go find the shield and silvery spear. Who else do the two enlist? BTW Sir Ray is not who you might imagine. He is a dog! The two dragons are filled with evil intent with never any remorse. It is time to end their rampaging but will Prince Martin and his crew succeed? Will Sir Ray survive his encounter with one of the dragons? This, the third book in the series, is a stand alone story but you’ll really want to start at the beginning if you have not already done so. FANTASTIC series! Written in rhyme but not set out like poetry. GREAT ending. I, as an adult, have read this entire fantasy series and you can pass them onto your kids with no fear of them reading something they shouldn’t. Chivalry is not dead. Thanks, Liz</blockquote>

        <h3 class="txt-medium">If you want your boys (and girls!) to be inspired by...</h3>
        <blockquote class="txt-medium">...courage and adventure, this is a series you can’t miss out on! I’m a firm believer in quality books, not just for toddlers, but also for budding readers. This is the perfect series to instill good qualities in your elementary age children while inspiring them to read! Mystery, danger, companionship and talking animals are all brought to life once again in Prince Martin and the Dragons, not to mention brightly colored illustrations that are surprisingly modern. Combined with the familiar bravery of Martin and his pals, their respectful mannerisms and courage to help those in need, and the lyrical flow of this adventure, these are sure to win over a reluctant reader (or a tired parent who has to read one more book)! We’ve read the first 2 books in the series multiple times and now the addition of dragons in this 3rd book only further solidifies my 5-year-old’s obsession with everything Prince Martin. We also have a 4 and 2 year old that love to listen in when I read these aloud as well as 2 nephews (ages 7 & 9) so it’s practically a guarantee that these will entertain for many years! We’ve only bought the Kindle versions of this series and there have been no errors in the publications. Great quality and we look forward to investing in the real books soon.</blockquote>

        <h3 class="txt-medium">If you have a young boy in your life, make sure he has this series!</h3>
        <blockquote class="txt-medium">The Prince Martin books are a rarity in our time - they unabashedly teach young boys that it is a GOOD thing to grow up to be brave, decisive, honorable men - yes, that boys can even aspire to become noble warriors! Yet, these important lessons are couched in rollicking verse that effortlessly entertains the young listeners (and introduces them to an astonishly advanced vocabulary, too). Prince Martin and the Dragon is considerably longer than the first two books, but is so compelling that it is easily read. Not to give anything away, but look for a passage that evokes Gandalf and the Balrog and is nearly as touching. And though this tale ends happily, be prepared to shed a tear or two at the final paragraph. In short, if you have a young boy in your life, make sure he has this series!</blockquote>

        <blockquote class="txt-medium">My son, who is eight, and myself have loved each of the Prince Martin books - including this one. They are wonderfully and uniquely written with beautiful illustrations. My son’s favorite picture is of the black dragon. I enjoy seeing my son act out the story. We look forward to the next adventure.</blockquote>

        <h3 class="txt-medium">Such an awesome series for young readers</h3>
        <blockquote class="txt-medium">Every book in the Prince Martin series has been such a joy to read — for both my son and me. My four-year old son and I often will read the entire book in a single sitting, which speaks to how well the Prince Martin stories keep your attention. Prince Martin and the Dragons is packed with action and adventure and the themes of bravery, courage, and self sacrifice are easy to pick up on for kids. I considered it the most exciting of the first three books. It also reads a bit differently thay the previous books. It’s especially fluid, and there are more and shorter chapters, which I think made it a bit easier for my son to digest each scene. Also, it seemed to contain a few more pictures than the prior books, which my son especially appreciated. I can tell he’s always eagerly waiting for that next picture! It’s a great read, and like the others I highly recommend it.</blockquote>
