        <blockquote class="txt-medium">Another Prince Martin classic! Brandon Hale does not disappoint with his latest adventure of the brave, loyal, and true Martin. Thoughtful rhymes, beautiful meter, and an unexpected challenge for our young hero make for an engaging read and a formative tale. I merely began reading aloud as soon as the book arrived, and within moments the usual noise subsided and the children gathered of their own accord and insisted that we continue to the end. Share this with your favorite youngster(s) and you’ll both be grateful you did.</blockquote>

We’re now especially glad to have a shorter Prince Martin that can be read to our youngest boys. Like all the Prince Martins, this one helps us teach our boys to love what is good and true, and to begin to have categories (formed by a story we can reference as a family) for courage & grit. And the illustrations are great!</blockquote>

Prince Martin is again our hero - there is nothing that young men can not do in service of a greater calling while being brave and true! Even with setbacks, things that are scary, things that are uncomfortable, he keeps his focus and completes his mission.

        <blockquote class="txt-medium">This series of books is truly charming in every way. The story is well written, able to keep the attention of the youngest to the oldest reader. The prose is easy enough for a 3rd grader to read on his own, but challenges them so they won’t feel like this is a baby story. My 7th and 8th grade children, who have read the Prince Martin chapter books, enjoyed this one just as much as their younger siblings. I love the character lesson in every Prince Martin story. Dealing with fear is such a difficult thing. Mr. Hale did an excellent job. I am going to share this as a read aloud with my 3rd grade class. Finally, the illustrations. The illustrations are so crisp and add to the story instead of detracting. These are my favorite books to give as birthday and shower gifts.</blockquote>

        <h3 class="txt-medium">Great New Prince Martin Book!!</h3>
        <blockquote class="txt-medium">I read this to my3 grandchildren, ages 4, 6, and 11 and they all LOVED it. The 6 year old is a BIG Prince Martin fan and has just started reading. I am sure he will be reading all the books himself soon. The 4 year old got scared in a couple parts when she thought the King or Prince Martin were going to get hurt, but she kept listening. The 11 year old was just as into it as her younger siblings, and grandma enjoyed it a lot. The premise of the book is really good and a good example for children of all ages to follow. Another GREAT book by Brandon Hale!</blockquote>

        <h3 class="txt-medium">Doing hard things is good for us - be excited to adventure with Little Prince Martin</h3>
        <blockquote class="txt-medium">This clever tale vividly paints the picture of a young prince learning to do hard things. We have read many Prince Martin books over the years and it was dear to see my 10 year old son soar through reading it and really enjoy the adventure. The witty rhyming style leaves room for regular vocabulary defining, which exceptionally grows reading skills. We were both delighted with the plot and appreciated the message that doing hard things is GOOD for us and should be expected in life.</blockquote>

        <blockquote class="txt-medium">My sons have been eagerly awaiting the next tale of Prince Martin. As soon as I gave it to them they flew through this story with the same enjoyment as the rest. Their only wish is that it was longer and they could keep reading the wonderful rhyming adventures. Love that it was inspired by a true story!</blockquote>

        <blockquote class="txt-medium">My boys were so excited to finally read the next adventure in the Little Prince Martin series! In this book we see Little Prince Martin take on his most courageous adventure yet. I love to see him grown in virtue that makes him into the young man from the Prince Martin series. He has a father that gives him responsibility, trusts him in small matters so that he can be trusted great matters, and still shows his son affection at the same time challenging him. Boys need more books like these!</blockquote>

        <blockquote class="txt-medium">My boys are always excited for the next installment of Prince Martin’s adventures. And, this one did not disappoint. The little prince Martin series is particularly good for younger readers in my house as they aren’t quite ready for the bigger themes in Prince Martin, but can enjoy them along with their brothers, nonetheless. Highly recommend.</blockquote>
