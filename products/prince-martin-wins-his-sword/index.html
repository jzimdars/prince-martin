<h2>Can a boy prince win his sword by proving he’s Brave, Loyal, and True in a crisis?</h2>
<p>Admiring the ancient steel in the castle armory, Prince Martin longs for a sword of his own. But the King decrees his son must prove himself first. The boy gets his chance when the caw of a crow alerts him to trouble in the forest. From the safety of the trees, he spies four terrifying villains bent on kidnapping an innocent victim! And the only thing standing between predator and prey is a courageous stranger—who could sure use a hand. Armed only with his wood staff and a rock sling, Martin faces the hard choice:</p>
