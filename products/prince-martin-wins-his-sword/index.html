        <h2>Can a boy prince win his sword by proving he’s Brave, Loyal, and True in a crisis?</h2>
<p>Admiring the ancient steel in the castle armory, Prince Martin longs for a sword of his own. But the King decrees his son must prove himself first. The boy gets his chance when the caw of a crow alerts him to trouble in the forest. From the safety of the trees, he spies four terrifying villains bent on kidnapping an innocent victim! And the only thing standing between predator and prey is a courageous stranger—who could sure use a hand. Armed only with his wood staff and a rock sling, Martin faces the hard choice:</p>
<p>Should he help or go home? The boy had to decide! And just how much help could a mere kid provide?</p>
<p>Featuring stunning full-color illustrations, Prince Martin Wins His Sword is a classic tale about a boy prince’s trials and how he learns the true meaning of courage, sacrifice, grit, and friendship.</p>
<p>With a great quest, high-stakes adventure, lovable heroes, and a mesmerizing cadence, this first entry in the new Prince Martin Epic series is sure to delight!</p>
<p>Ages 6 and up. Available in: Paperback, Hardcover, Kindle, and Audiobook. 9″ x 6″, 55 pages.</p>

        <h3 class="txt-medium">A Rare, Priceless Treasure</h3>
        <blockquote class="txt-medium">Discovering “Prince Martin Wins His Sword” was like finding a rare, priceless treasure. Authors and publishers simply don’t produce books as magnificent as this anymore. But Brandon Hale dared to write it anyway, and Jason Zimdars complemented the fantastic writing with several stunning, vivid color illustrations. A poem that is laid out like a novel, “Prince Martin Wins His Sword” features, together with its wonderful illustrations, a natural, flowing rhythm, line after line of masterful rhymes, and the thrill and excitement of adventure. This delightful tale will move its readers to aspire to such age-old and timeless virtues as bravery, loyalty, and self-sacrifice. “Prince Martin Wins His Sword,” together with its outstanding sequels, will inspire us all to be the best people we can be. Well done, Brandon and Jason!</blockquote>

        <h3 class="txt-medium">Promoting Virtue and Vocabulary, Written with Incredible Skill</h3>
        <blockquote class="txt-medium">Exactly what I was hoping for for my young boys, currently ages 6 and 4. It is a quick read that captures and keeps their attention, providing them with advance vocabulary exposure. I enjoy reading it aloud to them with it’s flowing cadence, and I am blown away at how syncopated this author is able to write. It promotes obedience, loyalty, bravery, and being true to your word. Something the world needs more of today. We plan on getting the entire series for them.</blockquote>
