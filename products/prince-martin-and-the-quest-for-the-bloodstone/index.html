        <blockquote class="txt-medium">My boys ages 14, 11, 6, & 7 have enjoyed every Prince Martin book and look forward to more. The Bloodstone was a little darker and more detailed than previous books. At times it was difficult for my younger boys to follow/understand but they still enjoyed it.</blockquote>

        <h3 class="txt-medium">An action-packed tale of betrayal, forgiveness, and redemption</h3>
        <blockquote class="txt-medium">Perhaps the most morally complex of the Prince Martin sagas so far, this novel explores some of the sinister attacks on masculinity, from over-competitiveness on the one hand to mindless screen-time addiction and total dissipation on the other. It also tackles issues of the female heart including the quest for beauty above all else, contrasted with a gentle, quiet, steadfastly heroinic spirit. And the story shows the importance of comradery above individual glory, while also demonstrating the path of redemption (and forgiveness) from a fatal mistake. With perhaps the most hideous enemy we have seen so far, this Prince Martin novel is a must-have in your collection. Don’t miss the other six if you haven’t read them already! There will be plenty to talk about with your sons (and daughters)!</blockquote>

        <blockquote class="txt-medium">At first, I had some trouble following the story - as one reviewer wrote, it jumps between characters and time lines. But as I read on, it became like an exciting movie and it all came together. Hale has obviously chosen to make each Prince Martin book longer than the last, with more difficult vocabulary and more intricate plots. Bloodstone may improve on a second reading. I’d give it 5 stars except I want to warn parents that it may be a stretch for younger readers/listeners. Like the six books that came before, Bloodstone balances pathos and logos, and leaves the reader improved by the experience. And it would, actually, make a good motion picture.</blockquote>

        <h3 class="txt-medium">Prince Martin continues to grow</h3>
        <blockquote class="txt-medium">It’s been almost 6 years of our time since Prince Martin first won his sword, and while he may only have aged about a year in the books, the themes, stakes, and world have grown immensely. The first hints of expansive worldbuilding came in Prince Martin and the Cave Bear, but it really kicked into high gear with the Last Centaur with the introduction of the Sower and Child tale that underpins the saga. It was great to see that story line expanded in this volume. The themes of this book are likewise expanded. In a bold move for a children’s story, Mr. Hale gives a glimpse of a mentor figure’s struggles and shortcomings. Yet he presents it in a way that teaches that struggles are a continuous part of life, rather than a nihilistic no-heroes view. This entry also sees the stakes increased. While one of the best parts of previous books has always been the very real life-or-death stakes, the results of failure have always been relatively limited in scope. Bandits and pirates might win for a time, but their victory will always be limited by the natural passing of time. The ancient evil and corruption in this story carries much more far-reaching potential, and the tension is noticeably higher. This book was also unique in that not all the lessons were for children. There is a subplot that is challenging to parents, as well. He grapples with the understandable desire of parents to keep children safe, and the unintended consequences of taking that desire too far.</blockquote>

        <blockquote class="txt-medium">We absolutely love the Prince Martin series. This story brings another dose of adventure, delightful rhyme scheme, and heroic virtue that leads to great discussions when read aloud and pure enjoyment during independent reading time in our home. I love how the series has grown with my son and the books have gotten progressively longer and more mature.</blockquote>

        <blockquote class="txt-medium">There are books that your children bring you to read that make you want to bang your head against a hard surface such as a wall or granite countertop. This book is not one of those. This book is a pleasure to read for both my 8 year old son and myself as well. In addition to being a good adventure story, there are also good character building lessons all throughout the story. Thank you for another excellent addition to the Prince Martin Epic!</blockquote>

        <h3 class="txt-medium">The only books my son likes reading! Epic tales with ingenious plots that teach kids to be heroes.</h3>
        <blockquote class="txt-medium">My son (who generally dislikes reading) has grown up with Prince Martin and the Brotherly Band. They are the only books he wholeheartedly gets excited about each time one is released. This latest Quest for the Bloodstone is another thrilling adventure—full of mystery, a marvelous plot, enchanting rhyme, and enriching vocabulary. As young readers follow our heroic characters in their latest battle against evil, they learn about bravery, fortitude, and loyalty. Highly recommended as a whole family read-aloud in order to get the most out of the rhymed prose, make predictions (and enjoy surprises) together as the plot twists and turns!</blockquote>

        <blockquote class="txt-medium">Every time I finish a Prince Martin book, I wonder how Brandon Hale is going to meet the standard he just reached. Yet, he keeps surpassing himself. The backstories get deeper and deeper, yet the rollicking rhyme makes these stories fun to read. I started off giving them to some friends of ours who were in elementary school at the time I found the books. They are now in 8th grade and 10th grade, and they always light up when I tell them a new book is out. THAT says a lot! Thank you, Brandon, for these wonderful books!</blockquote>

        <h3 class="txt-medium">Ever Faithful</h3>
        <blockquote class="txt-medium">This is the seventh book in the Prince Martin series that I’ve read to my son. We started with Prince Martin Wins His Sword before he could even read. And now that he is older, he still insists that I continue to read Prince Martin stories to him when they come out. He is an accomplished reader at 10 and perfectly capable of reading the book himself, but I never hesitate to spend time reading Mr. Hale’s books to him when asked. Our time with Prince Martin and his friends has become a tradition, and one that I’m only too happy to continue. Why? Because the books are full of adventure and exploration, but also heroism, sacrifice, friendship, loyalty, justice, generosity, and hope; traits and virtues that seemed to have fallen out of favor in today’s society in general and children’s books specifically. Prince Martin and the Quest for the Bloodstone is our favorite in the series thus far. The story is exciting as always, with plenty of twists and turns to keep young readers guessing. There is also a BBEG monster which the companions get to face. And of course all of the usual elements are present but in novel ways. But what made this tale stand out to me was the extensive backstory to set up an epic redemption arc. As I continued to read to my son nightly, we could sense the arc coming to fruition and when it finally happened, we were not disappointed. It was just as satisfying as the end battle. Well done Mr. Hale!</blockquote>

        <blockquote class="txt-medium">Great series for boys, and they just keep getting better! Hale does an excellent job developing a world where evil is real, and life isn’t always rainbows and butterflies; sometimes love looks like fighting for what is right and taking a stand against evil, and this is what boys need to learn. Wonderful tale of redemption, honor, courage, and lore. The Christian worldview always makes for the best stories!</blockquote>

        <blockquote class="txt-medium">The Prince Martin books are unique among children/young adult books. Each book tells an exciting adventure story, imparts moral wisdom, and is written in a wonderful rhyming scheme that pulls the reader more deeply into the story. This chapter of the Prince Martin series, “The Quest for the Bloodstone,” delivers to readers another fantastic quest to enjoy. The story starts off fast and engaging, and continues to be so right through the final pages. Oh, and of course I would be remiss to not comment on the illustrations — they are superb. I highly recommend this book and the rest of the Prince Martin books. They are family favorites in my house.</blockquote>

        <blockquote class="txt-medium">Prince Martin steps once again into our home to share his adventures and in doing so, to help instruct the imagination and character of my children in self sacrifice and diligence. We have been reading Prince Martin since my son was 8. Each new book seems to address a season of life he is going through. The Quest for the Bloodstone is no different. The themes of perseverance, faithfulness, and diligence abound in this book. The author does an excellent job developing the female characters to make this great choice as a family read aloud. This book does take a different approach however. Prince Martin takes a secondary role, as Ted the Treetender is in the front. There are several new supporting characters whose stories add a depth to the tale as well. Definitely one of my favorites!</blockquote>

        <blockquote class="txt-medium">If you’re looking for an exciting, adventure-filled book or series of books for kids, this is an excellent option. Prince Martin and the Quest for the Bloodstone is a treasure and a great addition to the Prince Martin series of books. It’s an exciting action-packed adventure story as a stand alone. It’s also a great addition to the Prince Martin series giving the back story on Ted the Treetender. Each subsequent book in the series provides additional characters and storyline while incorporating each of the characters from the previous books. This is a unique, entertaining story with a captivating plot and relatable, virtuous, heroic characters told in a fun rhyming text. It has a heavily detailed, well thought out storyline. The beginning of each chapter includes a picture that wets the appetite for the thrilling content of that chapter. I highly recommend both Prince Martin and the Quest for the Bloodstone as well as every book in this series. We have enjoyed reading them all over and over again.</blockquote>

        <blockquote class="txt-medium">The story begins with two young orphan elves, Tristan and Theo, who pickpocket a Treetender (an elf who is trained to protect a forest) instead of punishing them the Treetender named Telly encourages them to change their thieving and earn an honest living and maybe become Treetenders themselves! In a faraway forest many years ago the Sower and the Child were planting seeds, an evil creature bit the Child and was banished underground and named the Mullock. The rock the Child’s blood fell on was called the Bloodstone and the seed the creature Mullock spit out caused a moss to spread. Many years afterwards the Bloodstone gave life to the forest and its people, but the moss spread sickness and decay. The Treetender elf, Tadaaki, who tended the Bloodstone forest had disappeared, and Prince Martin and his friends were sent to find him and save the forest from the deadly moss. You will have to read the story for yourself to read of Tristan and Theo’s adventures, and the Quest for the Bloodstone!</blockquote>

        <blockquote class="txt-medium">We have spent days working on this review, of such, all of you will view. Mr Hale is an author Supreme, and his vocabulary is extreme. He makes us laugh, and doesn’t do things by half. His characters are bright and always do what’s right. The amount of suspense, keeps us incredibly tense! The books are uncategorical, the ultimate vocabulerical, allegorical, musical, liturgical... :musical_note::notes: (Sung with a pinache-full clang, to the tune of Chitty Chitty Bang Bang.) We’ll rhyme until we collapse! (There is no perhaps!) I’m decent at rhyming :smirk: It’ll sound like little bells chiming! And once we are done with our recitation, We must host a celebration! You will send it off without hesitation, And we shall all be full of elation! Thank you for another great tome, It has brought so much joy to our home. If you choose to read it, it will also help your mind to roam. Much beloved & captivating for all parties of our families, although a son is a particular fan & demands all the copies. Bright, fun pictures keep us captivated; we can’t wait for more, please stay motivated!</blockquote>
