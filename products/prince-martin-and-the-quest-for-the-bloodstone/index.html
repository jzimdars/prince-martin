<p>When a disgraced Treetender in search of a wondrous relic goes missing, Prince Martin and friends must journey to a faraway forest to find him. They soon discover that an unseen evil oppresses the gloomy wood. As the friends search for clues and uncover secrets, they come to a shocking realization: Unless they find the lost Treetender and recover the legendary Bloodstone, the forest faces an unimaginable fate...</p>
