          <p><b>Can Prince Martin rescue a blind cave bear kidnapped by a cruel Northman? </b></p>
<p>If your son is a reluctant reader, the Prince Martin Epic series is a perfect fit because each book features:</p>
<p> High-stakes action-adventure and danger</p>
<p> Action-packed illustrations that burst off the page</p>
<p> Text that appears to be prose--but <i>subtly rhymes,</i> gently nudging the boy along as he is encouraged to find the next rhyme</p>
<p>This is the perfect formula for engaging <i>boy</i> readers.</p>
<p>Parents and grandparents will love this series because each tale contains a moral--without a lecture--that encourages the virtues of bravery, loyalty, grit, and compassion, which are character traits boys need to become good men. And each book in the series gets a bit longer and more epic, thus growing with the boy.</p>
<p>Ages 8 and up.<br><br>Read as a stand-alone or as Book 4 in the series. </p>
<p>Available in the standard grayscale paperback edition, premium full-color paperback edition, and full-color hardcover edition. 9" x 6", 172 pages</p>
<p>Buy your copy now because your son will grow in virtue--and his heart will soar...</p>
