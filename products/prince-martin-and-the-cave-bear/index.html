        <blockquote class="txt-medium">I normally don’t take the time to write book reviews, but I just had to do it for this series and especially this book! Of course the author is extremely talented in writing stories all in rhyme, but more than that, these books are so engaging, exciting and fun to read; it’s hard to put down. This book taught about overcoming fear, helping others in need, don’t judge anyone, and disabilities are not disabilities at all! My kids (ages 5,7, and 9) loved this book, and I personally cried at the end of the story! It tied in the values and lessons Prince Martin learned along the way and how just because Torbin was blind, he was capable of so much more than the Prince thought. It was beautiful!</blockquote>

An adult can read aloud to lower level readers with the book being in level, imo, around 4th grade. My 2nd graders love to listen & always ask to hear more! They are not Christian-based but, utilizing personification in fables, pointing to morale teachings for all ages. We love Prince Martin!</blockquote>

This series combines those and adds virtue lessons into the mix. Knights, dragons, wizards, royal families, elves. Such a great cast of characters pulled together to tell a great tale of chivalry. As an adult, I enjoyed reading (and listening to my kids read it aloud) this tale. My younger children also listened along. Fun and captivating. Recommend!</blockquote>

The Cave Bear enlarged the scope of the series by terrain and characters. Prince Martin continues to grow in virtue and is guided by his trusty friend, Sir Ray. As usual, this book has a fast pace and the story is compelling. This is a great book for boys with enough excitement and peril to keep them interested as well as moral development when the characters make tough choices.</blockquote>

        <blockquote class="txt-medium">For the life of me, I cannot remember where I received the recommendation for the first Prince Martin book. I recall being impressed by the origins of the story, which began as a means to excite Hale’s children on phone conversations while he was deployed. As a military wife and mom, I appreciate that immensely, because we had to creatively inspire our kids in the same situation. I digress. My children received the first book for Christmas. They loved it. I loved it. All the books since have been a hit, but I will admit a special fondness for the latest, “Prince Martin and the Cave Bear,” primarily because it illustrates beautifully that we *all* have worth regardless of what initial impressions and assumptions are made. We all have worth despite what society says of our imperfections. We all matter. We all contribute. Brilliantly, the blind can enable the sighted to see clearly. My youngest child grapples with this idea, and Prince Martin answers the call. Additionally, facing fears is a constant subject in our home, and Prince Martin deftly dispenses with his own. Bravo, Mr. Hale.</blockquote>

Clever and engaging, this book weaves meaningful themes, descriptive vocabulary, and honorable heroes into a story that flows with rhythm. I really liked how this book foreshadowed details and tied it together with colorful descriptions and a fabulous cadance. In fact, my teens eagerly took turns reading it out loud with their younger brother! With a variety of main characters my kids all found someone with whom to identify! As a homeschool mom who also has a masters in education, this is exactly the kind of book I like to find for both my own children and also my classroom students. The end of the book has a vocabulary section, which is inviting and not intimidating for students. Highly recommended!</blockquote>

        <h3 class="txt-medium">Another Outstanding Entry in the Prince Martin Series</h3>
        <blockquote class="txt-medium">My 7 year son and 9 year old daughter love the Prince Martin Books. We read each of the previous books in one sitting and have come back to re-read them multiple times since first discovering them. For months and months they asked me almost every week when the newest entry in the series was due out. This has been an act of learning patience for them but finally Prince Martin and the Cave Bear was released... and they were not disappointed. This latest entry is approachable if this is your first Prince Martin adventure but even more enjoyable if you have grown to love some of the repeat characters. Each book teaches solid lessons that every parent should want their kid to learn. And, the cadence of the rhyming makes the books enjoyable and easy to read. Check this one out and enjoy!</blockquote>

        <blockquote class="txt-medium">My Son LOVED this book, and stated: “This is the best one yet!” He couldn’t wait to continue reading it when he woke up in the morning, and over the last couple of days on a trip when we were flying and driving, his nose was in the book! With enthusiasm, he would share with me what was happening in the book and his excitement couldn’t be contained. Over the past year, he has started reading chapter books on his own, and to have a book that pulls him in like this is an absolute treasure. As a parent, I love the writing style and the rich illustrations - it makes for a fun and enjoyable read together. I thoroughly enjoyed reading a couple of chapters aloud with him at bedtime, alternating pages, him then I, as the rhyming and the illustrations and the plot kept both of our interests!

Takes a few days for us to work through them, but the 8 year old has read one or two of them in a couple sittings. Without all the terrible stuff out there targeting kids, this is a great series to reinforce key virtues every kid needs to learn and have fun doing it.</blockquote>

        <h3 class="txt-medium">Best Book Ever</h3>
        <blockquote class="txt-medium">My seven-year-old daughter gives this book five stars! We kept hearing about Prince Martin, but we hadn’t been able to get our hands on Prince Martin books at the library yet, so we were psyched when we were given an advance copy in exchange for an honest review. NOTE: Even though we started at book four in the series, we didn’t feel totally confused. The morals are refreshing. Modern books seem to have so many disrespectful characters for young readers. This story focuses on characters with true grit, and it shows children how not to judge others so quickly. Princess Meg may be a small girl, but she can take care of herself! Characters with physical disabilities are shown as helpful and tough. The main crew of characters even shows mercy to villains. The words have a definite rhythm that makes this great as a read-aloud. Even though my child is at a fourth or fifth grade reading level, there is a lot of rich vocabulary since she’s only seven. Fortunately, there is a glossary of “power words” at the book’s end, and most words are used multiple times throughout the story to enforce their value and increase your child’s exposure to them. So, this is a fine book for many ages, just be aware you may need to explain some of the vocabulary to your child as you go. Our only complaint is that we wish there were more illustrations. They go along perfectly with the text, and they are sharp, bold — absolutely attention-getting! They are a bit cartoonish and a bit sophisticated all at once, making them enjoyable for all ages.</blockquote>

        <h3 class="txt-medium">My Grandson Will Be Thrilled</h3>
        <blockquote class="txt-medium">I just read the latest installment in the adventures of Prince Martin, and I’m sure that my grandson is going to love this one as well. The previous books are beginning to get dogeared from his re-reading and carrying them from home to Grandma’s so he’ll be sure to have something fun to read here. This episode includes characters from previous books, so reading the earlier books first probably helps, but it serves as a stand-alone book as well. In this episode Prince Martin and his younger cousin Prince Meg embark on a mission to help a cave bear who has been sold to a circus. The book has twists, turns, near misses, and heartwarming interactions. The author has made his job more difficult in this series by writing the stories in rhyme, but his makes it more enjoyable as a read aloud book. Grown-ups may well catch some Tolkien allusions in this book. The author is trying to encourage virtuous traits in boys with his stories. In this one, Prince Martin has to overcome fear and an outright panic attack in order to save one of his friends, and an unexpected individual says the day at an important moment demonstrating that even people whom you think can’t contribute much sometimes have unique abilities. I can’t wait to get this one in hard copy because there is a six year old who was hoping to find it in his Easter basket. I should note that he is a really precocious reader, and this book is totally appropriate for boys older than him as well, they may even appreciate the glossary at the end of the book more than he will just yet.</blockquote>

        <blockquote class="txt-medium">The Prince Martin books have been a family favorite for us. My oldest son took the first book in the series to school and now his whole class is hooked. We were all excited to read the 4th book. I love the strong, virtuous characters in all the books, and love the addition of Meg, Prince Martin’s cousin. The rhyming and beautiful illustrations make these books so fun to read aloud! And the lessons that are taught in the books are timeless: courage even when you feel scared, protecting the weak, showing kindness, loyalty. Thanks for writing stories I want to read to my kids!</blockquote>

        <blockquote class="txt-medium">My name is Caleb and I am 11 years old. I have read this whole series and I love these books. They have a lot of action and are really interesting. Prince Martin and his friends go on many adventures that are fun to read about, and the pictures are good too. I also like all the friendly characters, and especially Prince Martin because he is around my age and has a dog. If you read this fourth book, you will get a very good life lesson as well.</blockquote>

        <h3 class="txt-medium">A book to be read aloud!</h3>
        <blockquote class="txt-medium">We have loved every Prince Martin adventure since he first won his sword! This installment was no exception! This book begs to be read aloud, with its rhythm and canter, and my 4 children, ages 2 to 8, love the illustrations. This particular book is very intense at times because it deals with the reality of standing up for what is right, at all cost, facing the things one is most afraid of, and of confronting our own preconceived ideas about others. But, I can think of no better book, or book series to recommend than Prince Martin to address those topics with my children.</blockquote>

        <blockquote class="txt-medium">A princess makes her debut! We thought the addition of Princess Meg to the cast of characters was wonderful. Each book in the series seems to get better, and they’re such a joy to read as a family. If you read the Kindle version, I recommend turning on the word-wise function. My son is constantly asking what a word means, and this is a handy tool. As is the glossary at the back. Don’t miss that. The author has done a great job providing personal context for the use of different words. The words come to life more and are easier for my kids to remember. The stories are always gripping, especially for my son, and as parents, we really appreciate the consistent themes of loyalty, bravery, courage, and caring for others. But the educational and literary aspects of this book, like all the others, are just so valuable. Time is well spent with Prince Martin!</blockquote>

        <h3 class="txt-medium">They just keep getting better!</h3>
        <blockquote class="txt-medium">My grandchildren (ages 5–9) beg for the Prince Martin stories to be read to them when they visit. We have read every one in the series, & after the prince & his friends’ fight with the dragons (book 3), I thought that was as good as it could get. But I was surprised by Prince Martin & the Cave Bear. The heroes: a boy, an elf, a wolf and a dog are joined by a pint-sized heroine. They rescue a blind bear cub and risk their lives to return him to his family & home in the dangerous north, which is inhabited by fantastic beasts and fierce hunters. Prince Martin & his friends learn the value of compassion and doing right for right’s sake. They learn that a handicap doesn’t necessarily handicap someone. They learn that perseverance & hope are valuable virtues. My grandkids listened intently from the first page until the end. The glossary at the end was a fun addition as it explained words we hadn’t heard before (what it means to “count coup” & what a clowder of cats is - lol), which are now part of their vocabulary, just for the fun of it! These books are clean, very interesting, teach good principles (the Prince & Princess had to do a chore to earn the money to go to the circus, they are respectful to their parents, the friends are loyal to one another, they give their time to help others in need, etc.) Looking forward to this author’s next book. Keep them coming!</blockquote>

        <h3 class="txt-medium">Better and better, further up and further in</h3>
        <blockquote class="txt-medium">This series continues to improve - or rather, deepen. The writer seems to have hit his stride stylistically and the poetry seems to flow effortlessly, for all the work it must take to write and edit. The illustrations are deepening as well, showing more subtlety, as the themes of the story deepen book-by-book. Hats off to Messrs. Hale and Zimdars. The moral and life lessons are where I’m particularly impressed - from the simple story in the first book where there are a few clear-cut choices and the need to be brave and persevere, we have continued developments of that same theme, but coming closer to the sort of situations a child today may face - being laughed at, bullied, harrassed - but never compromising the moral. Building on the foundation of the previous, and bringing it closer to practical application. Deeper, step by step; or, further in and further up, as the Lion Himself would have it.</blockquote>

        <blockquote class="txt-medium">I just absolutely love this series! The virtues that all the book hold are phenomenal. The books are adventurous and exciting, yet not overwhelming for young readers. I homeschool two girls, ages 5 and 7. I have read all the book out loud to them because we have so enjoyed them together. This book would probably be their very favorite because of Princess Meg and the flying contractions are so wonderful to picture. When I pause at the end of the chapter to pick it up later in the day, my seven-year-old groans because she wants to continue! This is exactly the type of literature we need more of right now.</blockquote>
