        <h3 class="txt-medium">Fantastic!</h3>
        <blockquote class="txt-medium">As a former teacher and now homeschooling mom, I’m always on the lookout for quality children’s and Young Adult books. My kids have loved the Prince Martin series for years. They’re well written, entertaining, and teach great lessons. I’m absolutely delighted that there’s now a Prince Martin option for younger kids! First, it’s just a good story. My 5 year old has asked me to read it several times already. It’s engaging, as expected, and the additional illustrations helped keep his attention. There are a few less-common words, which I consider a positive. Use a good vocabulary, and your kids will develop a good vocabulary! My son was able to figure out the meanings of the unfamiliar words using context clues when I read it to him, but an early reader trying to read the story independently might need a little help with them. I’m always in favor of kids’ books with a good moral, and the author’s note at the end explains it’s a retelling of a personal experience, which is even better. It’s a great story and an excellent book! I hope this is the beginning of a long series of Little Prince Martin books! We will be buying them all.</blockquote>

Started reading these when my 9 and 8 year old boys were half their current ages and this book really piques the interest of my 5 year old boy being that it is more heavily illustrated than previous books.

Our family has long been a fan of Prince Martin, but this Little Prince Martin book is something special! We’ve enjoyed the chapter books as read-a-louds for the whole family ages 4–10, boys and girls. My younger ones love the books, but can’t enjoy them on their own. But this sweet little book is a perfect bedtime book to be read aloud. It can be read in one sitting, and the illustrations keep the attention of the little ones bringing keeping them engaged through the whole story! I love that my little readers can pick this up on their own and reread it through the illustrations. They get to enjoy Prince Martin just like their older siblings!</blockquote>

The Little Prince Martin story was a great way to introduce my youngest to the character and be able to use this story as a way to talk about honesty and how to make good decisions. Looking forward to more Little Prince Martin books!</blockquote>

        <blockquote class="txt-medium">Brandon Hale has again hit it out of the ballpark! My grandchildren have LOVED his chapter books and this new book for younger children will make my grandson smile from ear to ear. It is wonderful to be able to buy books with a great story and wonderful artwork and not have to worry that there will be unwanted surprises in the writing. I can’t recommend this book enough.</blockquote>

        <blockquote class="txt-medium">I have loved the Prince Martin chapter books from book one, they are the best for read aloud as rhyming books are so much easier on parents and grandparents. They’re perfect presents for birthday parties and Christmas or anytime— for grandchildren especially as we have six grandsons! I am delighted, keep going, Prince Martin!</blockquote>

        <h3 class="txt-medium">The Delightful Prince Martin for the Littlest Readers</h3>
        <blockquote class="txt-medium">Our whole family (children 9 and under) loves the Prince Martin series! This new book for young readers is just as delightful. Having a full picture book of Jason Zimdars’ stunning art is a treat! Brandon Hale’s writing is proof that you can (and should) tell an engaging story while also teaching virtue. The rhyming verse is fun to read for parents and children alike. My 6 yo was so excited that he could finally read a Prince Martin book for himself with “Honesty Pays”. No doubt, he’ll be devouring the rest of the series on his own very soon! Until then, we’ll keep reading one of our favorite series aloud over and over again starting with this fabulous picture book!</blockquote>

        <h3 class="txt-medium">Fantastic book for young boys!</h3>
        <blockquote class="txt-medium">Another great edition to the Prince Martin saga! The writing is clever and vivid while still age appropriate for younger children. The story includes an important moral lesson and is accompanied by the characteristically beautiful illustrations you expect from Prince Martin books.</blockquote>

        <blockquote class="txt-medium">My three boys loved this story (they’ve read all of the Prince Martin series). This one in particular was a favorite for my 10-year-old since it rhymed and helped him with reading. The author does a beautiful job showing how temptation feels and how it’s like a weed that can spring up and grow. I love how doing the right thing allowed a special ending to this sweet story. The coloring pages that are included are wonderful and made the story come alive for my kids. I’m thankful for good-quality books for my boys! The knight theme to this one was a favorite!</blockquote>
