        <h3 class="txt-medium">We love Prince Martin!</h3>
        <blockquote class="txt-medium">I was delighted to see another Little Prince Martin book released! My kids have really enjoyed the Prince Martin series, and the first Little Prince Martin is one of my 5 yr old’s favorite books. He was very excited about reading this new one! As always, there are positive themes about accountability, doing what’s right, etc. Also as usual, there were just a few advanced words that I had to explain. I like that these books encourage a good vocabulary, so that’s not a criticism in my opinion. I bought the kindle version of the book right away, and I will be getting the hard copy soon as well.</blockquote>

        <h3 class="txt-medium">Another solid offering from Prince Martin</h3>
        <blockquote class="txt-medium">Following in the footsteps of the older Prince Martin stories, this new picture book offers the same engaging art and rhyme that drew us to Prince Martin originally but makes it accessible to a younger crowd. However, like all good picture books, the treasures inside are not limited to just the young. The value of virtues and the wealth of vocabulary make it a worthy story for all ages. It inspires one to grow in virtue, to look at how to lend a hand, and to grow toward the person you are meant to be. We’re happy to add this new title to our collection!</blockquote>

        <blockquote class="txt-medium">My son has read all of the Prince Martin books where he is older, and he was very excited to read the books where Prince Martin is younger. He thought the book was “awesome” in his words. It’s great to have such wholesome books with characters that boys can look up to. Our family is always on the hunt for good books with good morals, and this series captures all of that! Another great Prince Martin work!</blockquote>

        <blockquote class="txt-medium">Brandon Hale never fails to surprise our family with his storytelling skills and keen sense of rhymes. The Prince Martin series is a great ongoing novel that also includes virtuous lessons, while also being extremely catchy and appealing to younger readers! The ultimate flow of all the chapters leading to the other, and the illustrations which show what exactly the text is referring to, really draws you in. Even for children with five-second attention spans, I think this book will be able to entertain and teach them about good morals! His poetry is never redundant, and it never gets old or boring! I recommend the Prince Martin books to any reader who appreciates poetry or even younger kids who enjoy bedtime stories! Phenomenal work! Thank you again for such an inspiring and thoughtful book, Brandon! As you say, remain loyal, brave, and true!</blockquote>

        <blockquote class="txt-medium">Brandon Hale has gifted his readers with a marvelous introduction to his main character in his latest book Little Prince Martin and the Seven Labors: Small Boys Can Do Big Jobs. Through accomplishing the birthday tasks his father gives him to do, the young prince earns many of the “rewards” the readers of the book series are familiar with including his boots, slingshot, and satchel. He also comes to recognize the merits of hard work (mucking out the stables…) learning lessons of accomplishment and charity. We highly recommend this read (and it’s best read aloud). Our grandsons gave it a 10 out of 10.</blockquote>

        <blockquote class="txt-medium">Have been a fan of the series for years. Boys don’t get these lessons without someone intentionally teaching them and our culture is proof of this.

The illustrations are wonderful and align well with the story. It is a great aid to use to get little ones to start doing chores and see the honor and virtue in not only helping others, but in doing what they are supposed to be doing.

This is a great prequel to his first book, Prince Martin Wins His Sword which is a family favorite. I like how he ties this story in with the storyline of the first book. Each subsequent book in the series ties in to something from the previous book. It’s well worth owning and reading the entire series. Each story teaches valuable character lessons in a fun format. The text has a rhythmic flow to it. It has beautiful, full color illustrations throughout. The whole series is very well done! Highly recommended!</blockquote>

Though the prince isn’t excited at the beginning, he soon finds a day full of skill-building and welcoming into the world of men. Our society doesn’t have natural markers for welcoming boys into manhood and it’s imperative on we as parents to develop these for our sons. This is a great example of how to do such a task for even a young boy. Wonderfully illustrated! Such a great book!</blockquote>

        <blockquote class="txt-medium">An endearing picture book for our Prince Martin home library collection. We love Prince Martin books in our family, and this is no exception. A shorter picture book style, Little Prince Martin is written in the same engaging rhyming text as the chapter books. In this brightly illustrated children’s book, Martin finds joy in helping others while spending the day with the Marshall, Steward, Blacksmith, Knight, Huntsman, and Armorer. Written in a way to hold the attention of our grandkids 6, 6, 7 and 8 (boys and girls) with its sense of adventure inspired by an Ancient Herculean epic, it also held rapt the attention of our two 4 year old grandkids - a testament to Brandon Hale’s storytelling gift and Jason Zimdar’s radiant illustrations.

        <blockquote class="txt-medium">I am loving the Little Martin series! The illustrations are absolutely delightful and artistically well done. This particular installment teaches the value of work in a charming way that reaches little ones right where they are. It is not condescending or a book that talks at them, rather it draws them in with a little boy that is just like them! As parents, we are always looking for ways to teach our children character without lecturing them. This series plants seeds of character deep in them that can be referred back to and built on.</blockquote>

        <h3 class="txt-medium">A Valulable Lesson for Prince Martin</h3>
        <blockquote class="txt-medium">Another excellent story written by Mr. Hale. Our kids love the rhyming nature of his stories, as well as his main character, Prince Martin, a young boy in this tale. Prince Martin has a valuable lesson to learn about serving others before himself in this story, and Mr. Hale executes that lesson with examples and language that is easy for young children to understand. Our kids were also able and excited to see the ties between this story and the Prince Martin novels. Overall, we enjoyed both the story and the delightful illustrations and highly recommend all of Mr. Hale’s Prince Martin books. These make great read-alouds for the whole family to enjoy together!</blockquote>

        <h3 class="txt-medium">Wonderful addition to an already excellent series!</h3>
        <blockquote class="txt-medium">This book is the PERFECT addition to the already excellent Prince Martin Series which has been as staple for my 4 boys as they have learned to read and grown into the epic adventures. I love that the Seven Labors story is bite sized for bed time, it brings in some grown up vocabulary that encourages parent involvement but still maintains the rhyming and cadence that has been demonstrably helpful for young readers. The theme of all the Prince Martin books is exactly what we need in our house (in our world) and we can not get enough of the adventures that are presented through a wholesome lens that speaks Virtue without being cheesy or preachy. It’s hard to choose, but this one might be my favorite of all because birthdays are a big important part of large families with lots of kids so it is right on point!!</blockquote>

        <h3 class="txt-medium">Family Favorite!</h3>
        <blockquote class="txt-medium">The Prince Martin series is our family’s absolute favorite! We can’t get enough of the engaging rhymes, character values, and Christian perspective. In the beautifully written story “Little Prince Martin and the Seven Labors,” Prince Martin celebrates his birthday. While one might expect it to revolve around him, the narrative takes a positive turn as he focuses on helping his neighbors instead. This book ignites imagination and even encourages adults to enhance their character. It has sparked meaningful conversations and questions, such as, “What can we do for our neighbors like Prince Martin did?” It’s been delightful to watch my children enjoy Prince Martin’s adventures and make connections on how they can be brave, strong, and supportive of those around them by looking beyond themselves.</blockquote>

        <h3 class="txt-medium">Short but Satisfying - Great Book for Boys</h3>
        <blockquote class="txt-medium">I have read with enjoyment every book in the world of Prince Martin, and this short storybook does not disappoint. The seven books in the Epic gradually grow in length and depth. This is a prequel, a good introduction to our young hero, and a stand alone story book that both pleases and teaches. I was surprised by the meatiness of the vocabulary. The five to eight year old target audience will need their parents’ help with “denote”, “facile” and “auspicious”. I had to look up “shoat” myself. But the story is very understandable, and relatable to the lads it’s aimed at. On his birthday, the Prince is sent out to perform seven useful tasks - and he gets rewarded with a practical gift each time. More importantly, he is given instruction on how to use his rewards, and he learns that work can be fun, that he should do things without being told - and that charity to the disadvantaged is blessed. The plot is clear and resolves itself by the end. I highly recommend this book about a princeling’s birthday. It would make a good gift for any lad; even better, make it a birthday adventure by tasking your little squire with missions that earn the same or similar rewards. Buy this book for your laddie. When he likes it, give him the seven books in the epic, which will grow with him. (There is a coloring book too.) Full disclosure - as a Prince Martin aficionado, the author advanced me the Kindle edition for review. But I have already ordered the paperback. Old fashioned adventurers prefer libraries to ephemeral phantom formats. And, btw, a “shoat” is a piglet just weaned. If I ever knew that, I had forgotten it.</blockquote>
