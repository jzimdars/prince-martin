<h2>Can Prince Martin persuade an ancient war hero to fight one last time to rescue the wilderness from the ruthless Marauders gang?</h2>
<p>When a raid shatters their tribe, twin Desert Dog puppies are forced to part. One brother is raised by the chief of the Marauder gang that terrorizes the desert. The other, by a peaceful hermit—who once, long ago, was the greatest of war heroes. Now grown and living worlds apart, one dog lives to protect a boy prince...the other, to guard his ghoulish master.</p>
<p>When a sudden tragedy puts their lives on a collision course, the forces of good face the forces of evil in a high desert showdown. And one brother must decide where his true loyalties lie. How will he make his stand?</p>
<p>Children will adore this suspenseful adventure because of the action, the art, and the riveting rhyming verse. Read it as a stand-alone or as Book 5 in the Prince Martin Epic Series.</p>
<p>Ages 9 and up. Read as a stand-alone or as Book 5 in the series. Available in: Paperback, Hardcover, Kindle, and Audiobook. 9″ x 6″, 194 pages.</p>
