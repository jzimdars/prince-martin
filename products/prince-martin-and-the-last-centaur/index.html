        <h2>Can Prince Martin persuade an ancient war hero to fight one last time to rescue the wilderness from the ruthless Marauders gang?</h2>

Now grown and living worlds apart, one dog lives to protect a boy prince...the other, to guard his ghoulish master.</p>
<p>When a sudden tragedy puts their lives on a collision course, the forces of good face the forces of evil in a high desert showdown. And one brother must decide where his true loyalties lie. How will he make his stand?</p>
<p>Children will adore this suspenseful adventure because of the action, the art, and the riveting rhyming verse. Read it as a stand-alone or as Book 5 in the Prince Martin Epic Series.</p>

        <blockquote class="txt-medium">Incredible and smooth rhyming style of writing doesn’t distract from the plot; but on the contrary adds to the intrigue and the complexity of the riveting stories! The chapters often end on cliffhangers and my 6-year-old begs for me to read more. Can be intense with the evil vs. good elements, but depending on your child’s capacity for it, provides a great springboard for conversation about life/death, courage, choices, character and more thoughtful, relevant topics for parents and kids. My son is obsessed with this series. It’s unlike anything we have ever read.</blockquote>

The rhyming scheme is wonderful, and employs some more advanced vocabulary to keep the rhythm and rhyme, and also makes it easier to for him to read. The themes of good and evil are very edifying. I LOVE that the centaur tells Prince Martin that courage does not mean an absence of fear. It is a choice every time. I also love the repeated theme of developing “grit.” This is a masterpiece to encourage reading and to encourage growth in virtue!</blockquote>

The story is well written and is prompting the reader to think beyond the text. As a parent its great knowing the book your child your reading is also inspiring and growing character as well as being a good read. Some words can be a challenge but with kindle reader and or a electronic dictionary readers will find the joy in learning new words. We started reading this book for nightly reading and had it read before the weeks was out. We started reading even before bed, after school and sometimes just read to find out what was happening next. These books will get you hooked and you will enjoy it! P.S. The author does a great job of connecting with readers by email! My son and I were so happy to receive the bonus chapter the same day we asked for it. He also included some great coloring pages which we have enjoyed as well.</blockquote>

They have loved the adventures and excitement in each book and look forward to each illustration. The rhythmic writing makes these books prefect for reading aloud, additionally as parent the bravery, moral decision making and loyalty of each character makes these books a joy to read to them. The extra chapters and coloring pages sent by the author have given my kids an additional connection to the characters and keeps them involved in the books. Brandon and Jason have a wonderful job with this series and I would recommend it for kids from age 5 on up. P.S. - Jason, my kids keep asking when the next book will be coming out and are excited to read it. Thank you and keep them coming.</blockquote>

        <blockquote class="txt-medium">My son is about to turn 8 and absolutely loved this book. I think that’s about the right age for this one. As other reviewers note, it’s a bit more intense. But as my son has grown up reading these over the past few years, it was perfect and had him captivated. It’s longer than others in the PM series but still packed with great illustrations throughout. While we’ve been able to read a few in a single sitting, this one definitely required a few evenings. Every night my son was begging me to read “just one more” chapter. I love that my son finds these books so thrilling, and that at the same time I know he’s getting exposed to some great messages ... character formation, the battle between good and evil, and the virtues. As with all in the PM series, it’s such an educational read. There isn’t a better series of books out there if you want to build your kid’s vocabulary. Lots of conversations as we read about what a word means. Would really love to see this turned into a mini series some day!</blockquote>

        <blockquote class="txt-medium">I’ve read all the Prince Martin books to my sons, ages 7 and 4, at least twice. The latest book in the series did not disappoint! Written in a rollicking rhythm, the stories are a joy to read aloud, filled with adventure, daring deeds, and acts of integrity. I am so happy to have found books that hold my children’s attention and capture their imagination, while also giving them heroes of character and virtue. My boys beg to hear the stories again and again and pour over the illustrations. They love to act out the adventures of Martin and Sir Ray. Prince Martin and the Last Centaur tells the back story of Sir Ray, Prince Martin’s canine companion. Lost knights, an ancient centaur civilization, a tribe of white dogs in the desert, and a villainous baboon all combine in a gripping tale of loyalty and courage.</blockquote>

        <blockquote class="txt-medium">One of my sons is a very reluctant reader. The Prince Martin books have been a huge help in getting him interested and excited about reading. He loves these books! When I asked him what he thought about this book in particular, and he said, “ I love this book. It is my favorite book in the series and I can’t wait to read the next one!” Thanks so much to the author for this book and the entire series!</blockquote>

        <h3 class="txt-medium">The Prince Martin books are awesome!</h3>
        <blockquote class="txt-medium">Prince Martin & the Last Centaur was such an exciting book! We couldn’t put it down. I read this with my 9 year old son & it teaches wonderful lessons of bravery & loyalty. The main characters stand up for those who can’t help themselves & defend them against the enemy. We highly recommend this book.</blockquote>

        <blockquote class="txt-medium">My 10 year old son has loved reading the Prince Martin books and recently read the newest one, Prince Martin and The Last Centaur. Before we found the Prince Martin books I had a hard time with him not wanting to just sit down and read. However, the Prince Martin books have been a game changer! Our son now loves to read and has a hard time putting the books down! He has even re-read the Prince Martin books! Below is his review on the book, Prince Martin and The Last Centaur: “I just finished reading Prince Martin and The Last Centaur. It was better than I expected! It was exciting and maybe even better than the other ones. I would recommend it to my friends and everyone else!” Our family loves the Prince Martin books and we would definitely recommend them for any young reader and their families!</blockquote>

        <blockquote class="txt-medium">Prince Martin, Sir Ray, John a fierce wolf, and Ted, a wood elf, join together to save the land of the South from being overtaken by a fierce baboon. A legendary creature called a centaur is hundreds of years old, can help but he has an enemy with a dastardly plan! The colorful illustrations add to the story’s drama and give details to the characters and the adventure.</blockquote>

        <blockquote class="txt-medium">My son & I LOVED this book! All of the Prince Martin books are doing such a great job of encouraging boys to pursue biblical manhood. Examples of justice & mercy ... overcoming fear & showing courage ... the love & pursuit of adventure ... good vs. evil. Tremendous storytelling that is compelling and creative! My son plays out the books in his imagination for days after reading these books! The only problem I have is trying to read something else after reading Prince Martin, because I get into such a groove of reading in verse. HAHAHA!</blockquote>

        <blockquote class="txt-medium">We are BIG Prince Martin fans! This tale did not disappoint, and my children are already asking when Brandon Hale’s next adventure will be out! Like all in the series, it’s holds the attention of all each of my children (ages 3,5,7,9), and because of the rhyming/rhythmic structure, these are one of my favorites to read aloud. Plus they continue to form the spirit of adventure, calling, bravery, and gift of self in my children (and myself). They’re one of our favorite gifts to give too!</blockquote>
